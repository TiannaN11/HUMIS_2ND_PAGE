                    <p><span>MATTHEW BASSO |</span> Matt Basso, jointly appointed in History
                        and Gender Studies, comes to the University of Utah from the University of Richmond where he was
                        an Assistant Professor of History and American Studies specializing in 20th century political,
                        social, and cultural history. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota’s Program
                        in American Studies in 2001, his MA in history from the University of Montana in 1996, and
                        taught in various roles at both those universities as well as in the U.S. Army while serving in
                        Germany during the Gulf War.
                    </p>
                    <p>He retired as a Captain in 1994. Prior to his stint in uniform he spent four glorious years at
                        Vassar College where his keen interest in gendered relations of
                        power was born. He is currently working on a book project, “Metal of Honor: Montana’s World War
                        <img src="Screenshot%202024-10-17%20at%206.34.55%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="matthew"
                             class="image-wrap"/>
                        II Homefront, Movies, and the Social Politics of White Male Anxiety,” that will be published by
                        the University of Chicago Press. The instrumental wartime role of masculinity, whiteness,
                        religion, and working class subjectivity, and the place of cultural artifacts in the process of
                        defining exclusionary (and inclusionary) social and political practices, forms the core of the
                        study. He is also the co-editor of Across the Great Divide: Cultures of Manhood in the U.S.
                        West, (New York: Routledge, 2001), and is editing a lost Federal Writers’ Project Manuscript
                        from the 1930s. He spent the 2003-2004 academic year in New Zealand as a Senior Fulbright
                        Scholar beginning work on his next project: a comparative transnational exploration of racial
                        and gender formations among Pacific settler societies (New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the
                        U.S.).</p>
